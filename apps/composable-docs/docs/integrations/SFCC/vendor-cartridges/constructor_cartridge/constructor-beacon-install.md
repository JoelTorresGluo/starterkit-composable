A Constructor beacon is a JavaScript snippet configured on your website to capture anonymous user clickstream activity. This data is sent to Constructorâ€™s servers to train AI models, helping users find products and content.

### Where to Load the Beacon
Install the beacon on all pages except those with sensitive data like account management and credit card information. Important pages include:

- Home Page (and any page with a search bar)
- Search Result Page (Search Product Listing Pages)
- Browse Result Page (Browse PLP)
- Product Detail Pages (PDP)

### How to Load the Beacon
The recommended method is direct site placement, as tag managers can be blocked by ad blockers, impacting up to 40% of users. Install the beacon script after a DOM Ready or Window Loaded event, or at the end of the page.

#### Direct Site Placement (Recommended Method)
For best results, install the beacon directly on your site.

#### Tag Manager Options (For Proof Schedule)
- Google Tag Manager
- Tealium iQ
- Adobe Launch
