## Limitations

The cartridge must be downloaded and installed by a developer or agency for your SFCC instance. Currently, this integration does not support:

- **Consents as Events**: Customer flags can be imported as part of the Customers feed.
- **Web Tracking**: Use our JS SDK to handle web tracking in your Tag Manager separately.
- **Real-time Tracking (\>2 minutes)**: The cadence is defined on the SF side, depending on the export jobs.
- **Multi-storefront Installations**: No support for separating out data into different projects. The cartridge exports all data into files without filtering by storefronts. This is an issue if you want data separated by storefront into multiple Engagement projects (e.g., by region).

### Main Integration Steps

1. Cartridge Installation

2. Assigning Cartridges to the Site

3. Import Metadata

4. Service Configuration

5. Custom Site Preferences

6. Configure Product and Content Fields

7. Set Up Certificates

### Additional Considerations

- **Log Errors**: Monitor error logs in the customlog-Bloomreach log file.
- **API Limits**: Avoid running jobs more than once every 10 minutes to comply with Bloomreach API limits.
- **Support**: Contact your Bloomreach Success Manager for any issues or questions.
