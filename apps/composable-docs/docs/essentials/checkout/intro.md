# Overview

The Checkout implementation within the Orium Accelerator is engineered to provide a high-quality developer experience and enable ease of customization, extension, and creation of unique checkout experiences. It provides reusable modular components for common checkout features and follows a defined pattern for constructing and combining new user checkout journeys. Each user checkout journey is referred to as a **checkout experience**, and the overall architecture and implementation patterns are collectively known as **Checkout Experiences**.

## Getting Started

To develop **Checkout Experiences**, it is recommended to read through the following sections and learn about xState, a fundamental library for **Checkout Experiences**.

### Architecture

The architecture of Checkout Experiences utilizes the [xState](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xstate) node library, which enables the management of numerous and intricate UI states that can arise in the React components throughout a customer's checkout journey.

"xState is a state management and orchestration solution for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It uses event-driven programming, state machines, statecharts, and the actor model to handle complex logic in predictable, robust, and visual ways."


With xState, we can implement a state machine that handles the state management complexities that arise during a customer Checkout journey.

For detailed information and documentation on xState, refer to the [official website](https://stately.ai/docs).

### Why use a state machine?

The checkout process in an e-commerce site is a complex system with numerous interactive data touchpoints between backend systems and the customer. This complexity makes it a challenging component to construct, maintain, and scale. Some of the technical challenges include:

- A UI state management system that responds to all possible actions performed by the customer in a maintainable and scalable pattern.
- Identify synchronous and asynchronous actions that need to occur before, during, and after a transition from one state to the next, and ensure they occur in the correct order.
- The ability to resume and reinitialize a customer's in-progress checkout journey in order to recover from a page refresh or redirect.
- Ease of maintenance, customization, and scalability to accommodate the creation of unique targeted experiences for different customer segments.

State machines help address these complexities, streamlining the management of the checkout process:

- A state machine enables us to establish a rigid set of states, each with available transitions to other states, and actions to be executed before, during, and after a state transition.
- The context of the state machine maintains all the information about the current state, serving as a data store that can be accessed and updated during state transitions.
- A state machine can be re-initialized to a current state using a previously saved context loaded from memory.
- State machines in xState support TypeScript, enhancing the developer experience. This ensures developers work within the constraints of the defined state machine when modifying or adding new features. This acts as a guardrail for developers and helps prevent users from entering a dead-end or faulty state during their checkout journey, which ultimately boosts conversion rates.

### How to learn xState

:::important
Please note that Checkout Experiences is constructed using **xState v5**, which has substantial differences from xState v4. Exercise caution when referring to external documentation, tutorials, or blogs that are exclusively relevant to v4.
:::

- Glance over the [xState v5 documentation](https://stately.ai/docs)
  - There is a lot of information, so try to just gain a high-level overview of the concepts: states, transitions, events, actors, and actions
    - Read and bookmark the [cheatsheet](https://stately.ai/docs/cheatsheet) that contains critical information on the most important concepts
    - Read and bookmark [Events and Transitions](https://stately.ai/docs/transitions)
  - Actors play a critical role in the Checkout Experiences system and allow us to modularize distinct parts of a typical checkout user journey, which can then be reused to compose multiple different checkout experiences.

- Read [this blog](https://stately.ai/blog/2023-12-01-xstate-v5) covering the v5 release at a high level
- The [Stately Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Statelyai/videos) is a good resource to understand XState. Videos made prior to Dec 1, 2023, will most likely cover xState v4.
  - See [Webinar: Get started with XState v5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRVjeil-y74)
- This [xState v4 YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5dAlGaqhck&list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4ocSi17y1JmMmz7S5cV8vI), while out of date, is still great at explaining the fundamental concepts of xState. If you follow these videos, then reading the [v5 release blog](https://stately.ai/blog/2023-12-01-xstate-v5) will further cement these ideas and how to use them in v5.
- Refer to the Stately GitHub repository's [code examples](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/tree/main/examples)
