Established in 2003, Wine Critic Robert Parker bestowed upon wine made from grapes harvested from Theopolis Vineyards a stellar rating of 94-96 points, a spectacular showing for the vintner’s first harvest in 2006.\n\nABOUT THEO-PATRA, QUEEN OF THE VINEYARDS\n\nMs. Theodora Lee, a senior partner and trial lawyer at Littler, founded Theopolis Vineyards in 2003. In the wine world, Ms. Lee is known as Theo-patra, Queen of the Vineyards. Her passion for wine began upon her arrival to San Francisco from Texas in 1987, primarily due to the influence of her law firm mentors, many of whom owned vineyards. This led Ms. Lee to take several viticulture classes at UC Davis, before deciding to develop her own vineyard. In 2001, Ms. Lee purchased sheep land in the Yorkville Highlands of Anderson Valley, and began developing her vineyard. This process was quite complex from clearing land, doing soil tests, obtaining permits to remove some trees, drilling an agricultural well, and terracing the property. Finally, in 2003, Ms. Lee planted her 5 acre vineyard. Ms. Lee adopted her Greek name from pledging Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, and established Theopolis Vineyards.",

The vineyard is made up of around 70% Pinot Meunier, 20% Pinot Noir and 10% Chardonnay.\n\nTo obtain the highest possible quality of grape, all the work in the vines and winemaking is done locally and exclusively by hand, and out of respect for the environment, the vineyard uses integrated pest control methods on the estate.\n\nABOUT MARVINA\n\nGrowing up, M. Robinson’s love affair with champagne began quite humbly as a college student. She and her friends would often pool their limited funds to purchase a bottle of Moet & Chandon, White Star. They frequented a liquor store on Fulton Street and St. James Place within the neighborhood she was raised. They would do the traditional toast, cheers and proudly sip out of their plastic cups. Although this Bottle of Nostalgia was discontinued, it stoked a love for champagne in Marvina’s heart that would burn brightly until this day.\n\nM. Robinson desired her own brand of champagne to serve as the private house label for her upcoming champagne bar. In order to achieve that goal, she worked with a vineyard in France to create Stuyvesant Champagne. The first tasting of Stuyvesant Champagne was hosted by Suite 607 located in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  This was the first official tasting in the United States with invited guests. After receiving great feedback from the carefully selected attendees, she was able to confirm the two selections that would become the primary offering of Stuyvesant Champagne; a Rose and a Grand Reserve Brut.\n\nOne of M. Robinson's fondest memories of champagne occurred in January of 2019 when she visited the famous Les Deux Magots in Paris, France. She sat outside in the cold, under a heated lamp, chatted with a fellow patron and sipped champagne as they did in the movies. \n\nM. Robinson has a zest for life and travels and hopes to bring a taste of home, spice and culture to the Champagne community.  She is one of the few African American women owning a Champagne brand. Her love for her hometown, Bedford-Stuyvesant (Brooklyn, NY), inspired the name of her brand, Stuyvesant Champagne.\n\nShe invites you to raise a glass and toast to the freshness of family and beginnings of a strong and fruitful relationship.",

Leading a new generation of winemakers, they bring their family knowledge, methods and passion to the many wines they now make together.In the 1930s, Julie’s grandfather, René de Médeville, was feeling the effects of the economic slump that had hit the whole area, so he built concrete vats to replace costly barrels. After a few years, he observed that the wines were breathing well, maturing more slowly and developing more complex aromas. For more than half a century, the Médevilles have let their Sauternes age for decades in concrete vats. The wines never see the inside of a wooden barrel; they go directly from vat to bottle. Although Gilette was not included in the 1855 classification, its wines can compete with the best.Château Gilette is unique not only in Sauternes but in the world, as wines are aged between 15 and 25 years before release.

His family inherited the land in Eguisheim following WWII, and his parents, Jean-Louis and Fabienne, inherited the property from Jean-Louis' parents in 1982. Previously known as 'Mann Henri,' in 1998, they decided to make their first wines under Jean-Louis et Fabienne Mann's name. A region steeped in tradition and pedigree each generation has imprinted a signature on the family Domaine. One of three brothers, Sébastien, pursued a BTS in Oenological Viticulture before further expanding his knowledge by seeking experiences such as in Champagne (Vouette et Sorbee and Bertrand Gautherot), Côte Rôtie (Pierre Gaillard), Austria, and even Australia, returning home with an innovative perspective. In addition, he worked in Alsace with such highly regarded producers such as Albert Boxler, Barmes Buecher, and Julien Meyer. The Estate has been certified organic since 2008 and biodynamic since 2009. The 12.8 hectares (12 to white varietals and .8 to red) are planted with the following grapes: Sylvaner, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Muscat à Petits Grains Blancs, Auxerrois, and Pinot Noir. There are three main categories to the wines:Vins de Soif: A single varietal, or blend, from young vines; the wines are ethereal, fresh, dry, and fun.Vins de Terroir: Single vineyard wines, not of Grand Cru status, complex yet approachable in youth. Grand Cru: The crème de la crème, of which two are produced: Eichberg and Pfersigberg, both layered and ageworthy and considered some of the most sought-after white wines in the world. In addition, he produces two superb Pinot Noir, Vendanges Tardives, and SGN. Sébastien creates a delicious Cremant D'Alsace Brut Nature with partial barrel aging from his knowledge gained during his stage at Vouette and Sorbée in Champagne. More importantly, the Domaine represents a style we have long sought in Alsace; the wines are singular, pure with superb balance and a stately complexity. Sébastien implemented a sweetness scale on the back label that considers the sugar, alcohol, and acidity levels, designed to preview the wine. In a world where Alsatian wines confuse the savviest of drinkers because of the unknown dry or sweetness factor, it is one of the most accurate depictions seen in Alsace. It is a family with intricate knowledge of the various Alsatian terroirs. Their property represents multiple soil types, grape varietals and the wines reflect the vineyards' unique character. Sébastien embodies a new generation of talented vignerons producing beautiful wines balanced in their power, extract, and finesse.",

A region known before phylloxera as a prominent part of Burgundy now represents a small fraction of wine produced. The quality level can be exceptional, especially considering rising global temperatures and the ability to have a more temperate growing season. Édouard Lepesme built his career in marketing for negociants in Burgundy and Champagne. In 2011, he decided to follow his dream and immersed himself in winemaking and viticulture, studying with some of France's\ngreat names, such as the highly respected De Moors. In 2014, he purchased 33 acres (13.5 planted to vines) from Andre Donat. The latter's father was a pioneer vigneron in the area when he planted Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Aligoté, and Gamay Noir in the 1960s. In the village of Vaux-Auxerre, the terroir is the same chalky limestone soil as Chablis. Édouard produces only a small amount of high-quality wine and sells most of his fruit to other winemakers (including the De Moors). His vineyards are farmed organically since the 1990s, and they are surrounded by beautiful cherry trees and organic wheat fields,\nadding to the biodiversity. The vineyard plots are planted on the two hillsides of the village of Vaux. The vineyard positioned between Vaux and Auxerre tends to have more clay, while the vineyard south of Vaux, more limestone. Using 100% organic and biodynamic viticulture, Édouard has a hands-off approach- hand harvesting, fermentation with indigenous yeasts, and low sulfur. The red wines are fermented primarily with whole clusters. His resulting wines show great purity, finesse, and balance.\n\nViticulture & Vinification\nGrape Variety: 50% Pinot Noir/ 50% Chardonnay\nSoil: Clay-limestone\nFarming: Biodynamic, Certified Organic\nVineyards & Viticulture: Organic viticulture since 2014\nHarvest & Vinification: Manual harvest, native yeasts.

Some notable aromas on the bouquet include fresh roasted coffee, blackcurrant, crème de cassis, luxardo cherries, perfume, fresh violet petals, dark cherry liqueur, and hints of forest floor, sage, freshly cut cedar chips, with an intriguing musky nuance. Upon entering the palate, oodles of dark fruit, blackcurrant, cassis, fresh rose petals, water chestnuts, and subtle hints of licorice expand into a luscious, long-lasting espresso crème brûlée finish. The mesmerizing complexities between the balanced, full-body character interlaced with the structured yet velvety tannins may cause frisson with certain individuals. Proceed with delight!\n\nMother Nature in 2015 was not very nice to us, but evidently, this was a blessing in disguise. We experienced another drought year, shatter in the spring, and a heat wave with temperatures over 100° late in the season. Even with the atypical growing period, 2015 was yet another epic Napa Valley vintage where the stars aligned for us. Although we lost approximately 35% of our total yield due to shatter, the final fruit quality was SUPERB - and has created the best wine we have ever made! After waiting three years on a wait list, in 2015 we were also very fortunate to obtain First Growth fruit out of Oakville (adjacent to a very famous, iconic Napa Valley winery who charges $1000+ per bottle) to blend together with our ultra premium Howell Mountain, Atlas Peak, Pritchard Hill, and Silverado Bench fruit. We barrel-aged all five Bordeaux varietals in 90% new French and Hungarian oak for 23-months, adding elegant, balanced structure without overpowering the essence of the unique terroir. Furthermore, in 2015, we hired Andrew Opatz as our vineyard manager for our Rockwell Ridge estate vineyard on Howell Mountain and he immediately got to work improving the vineyard.",

His family inherited the land in Eguisheim following WWII, and his parents, Jean-Louis and Fabienne, inherited the property from Jean-Louis' parents in 1982. Previously known as 'Mann Henri,' in 1998, they decided to make their first wines under Jean-Louis et Fabienne Mann's name. A region steeped in tradition and pedigree each generation has imprinted a signature on the family Domaine. One of three brothers, Sébastien, pursued a BTS in Oenological Viticulture before further expanding his knowledge by seeking experiences such as in Champagne (Vouette et Sorbee and Bertrand Gautherot), Côte Rôtie (Pierre Gaillard), Austria, and even Australia, returning home with an innovative perspective. In addition, he worked in Alsace with such highly regarded producers such as Albert Boxler, Barmes Buecher, and Julien Meyer. The Estate has been certified organic since 2008 and biodynamic since 2009. The 12.8 hectares (12 to white varietals and .8 to red) are planted with the following grapes: Sylvaner, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Muscat à Petits Grains Blancs, Auxerrois, and Pinot Noir. There are three main categories to the wines:Vins de Soif: A single varietal, or blend, from young vines; the wines are ethereal, fresh, dry, and fun.Vins de Terroir: Single vineyard wines, not of Grand Cru status, complex yet approachable in youth. Grand Cru: The crème de la crème, of which two are produced: Eichberg and Pfersigberg, both layered and ageworthy and considered some of the most sought-after white wines in the world. In addition, he produces two superb Pinot Noir, Vendanges Tardives, and SGN. Sébastien creates a delicious Cremant D'Alsace Brut Nature with partial barrel aging from his knowledge gained during his stage at Vouette and Sorbée in Champagne. More importantly, the Domaine represents a style we have long sought in Alsace; the wines are singular, pure with superb balance and a stately complexity. Sébastien implemented a sweetness scale on the back label that considers the sugar, alcohol, and acidity levels, designed to preview the wine. In a world where Alsatian wines confuse the savviest of drinkers because of the unknown dry or sweetness factor, it is one of the most accurate depictions seen in Alsace. It is a family with intricate knowledge of the various Alsatian terroirs. Their property represents multiple soil types, grape varietals and the wines reflect the vineyards' unique character. Sébastien embodies a new generation of talented vignerons producing beautiful wines balanced in their power, extract, and finesse.",

The Mosel River stretches from its spring in the French Vosges along the Luxemburg border for almost 320 miles northeast, where it finally empties into the Rhine near the quaint town of Koblenz. The Saar and the Ruwer serve as its two tributaries along the way and are part of the overall Mosel wine region.\n\nThe Mosel is considered to be Germany's oldest wine growing region with production dating back to Roman times. It is also considered the world's steepest wine growing region with over 50% of vineyards situated at inclines of over 30°. It is home to the world's steepest vineyard, the Bremmer Calmont, which has an incline of 65°.\n\nWhile wine production has existed here for many centuries, the cultivation and harvest has always remained problematic. The mechanization that has made the lives of vintners in other parts of the world so much easier has proven difficult or impossible to apply to many of the Mosel's steep slopes. Wine production here is a tough, backbreaking job and, in that way, little has changed in the last 2000 years. From pruning and weeding to the harvest itself, most of the work is still done by hand.\n\nVINTAGE NOTES\n\n2019 is an exceptional vintage in Germany. It’s a vintage that has both excellent ripeness and bright, crisp acidity. It was not the easiest vintage; the weather patterns were more extreme than previous years and varied from region to region and even village to village. The harvest required quick decision making and long days but the hard work resulted in a beautiful array of wines. Across Germany, it’s a vintage that shows great range and depth. The wines from 2019 are a pleasure to drink now and will develop gracefully for decades.",

His father, Christian, has been running the Saint Chamant Champagne house since 1950, and he lovingly sent his son out to start his own estate when Stéphane was 25. Though mentored by his father, Stéphane developed a very different style of expression at his own house, creating leaner, drier Champagnes, primarily from Chouilly (Grand Cru), Cuis (1er Cru 99%) for Chardonnay, and d'Aÿ (Grand Cru) and Mareuil/Aÿ (1er Cru 99%) for Pinot Noir. Meticulously committed to organic practices, Stéphane avoids herbicides at all costs.

With auspicious soil, ideal climate, precision irrigation, and refreshing breezes, our winemaking team does very little to interfere with the natural fruit. Their approach is to respect the balance in the vineyard and then reveal the true character of Red Mountain in the cellar.\n\nRed Mountain’s great strength is its Cabernet Sauvignon. The Aquilini family planted nearly 70% of their acreage with it and selected 16 different clones to offer a full spectrum of blending possibilities. The wine is aged for 24 months in new French Oak. As subtle characteristics emerge, the winemaking team creates two blends. Aquilini’s Grand Vin is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, characterized by incredible layers and selected for optimum aging capacity. Concentrated and structured, the Grand Vin strives to capture the signature power and tannin of Red Mountain fruit.\n\nAt the guidance of the renowned consulting winemakers at Atelier Melka, in-house winemaker Even Johansen, and an elite vineyard team led by Andrew Schultz, the Aquilini vision is to express the best of Red Mountain through an unwavering commitment to quality.",

    "producer_bio": "Champagne Saint-Chamant\nCôte des Blancs, Champagne, France\n\nChampagne Saint Chamant was established in 1930 by Pierre and Hélène Coquillette. Their son, Christian, took over the estate in 1950. Located in Épernay, the house's unsigned, unassuming exterior in no way hints at its labyrinthine cellar, built in the early 19th century, which is a mile long - and lined with hundreds of thousands of carefully aging Champagne bottles. Charmingly mustached and quite dapper, octogenarian Christian specializes primarily in Blanc de Blancs with more than 28 acres of Chardonnay vineyards in Grand Cru Chouilly. The house also makes a small amount of rosé, from 92% Chardonnay and 8% Pinot Meunier from Épernay. Christian is a firm believer in extended lees aging, and he disgorges only once the wines have been ordered. All Saint Chamant Champagnes are of a distinctive style and sophisticated quality, reflecting well the elegance and refinement of their maker. They display a heady, old-time richness and vinosity with extremely fine bubbles.\n\nViticulture & Vinification\nGrape Variety: 100% Chardonnay\nSoil: Limestone\nVineyards & Viticulture: Christian exploits 11.50 hectares of vineyards, of which 11.4 hectares are dedicated to Chardonnay production. This wine is issued 100% from Grand Cru Chouily, Côte de Blancs. Average vine age is 25 years old.\nHarvest & Vinification: All grapes are hand-harvested. Average elevage time is for nine months, in stainless steel and enamel tanks.",
