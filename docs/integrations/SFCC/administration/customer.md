## Address Books

In SFCC, customer addresses are managed using Address Books. These addresses can be used for both Shipping and Billing addresses during checkout. Customers can identify a specific address as their preferred address, so it can be used to select a Shipping or Billing address by default.

- **Address ID** _(string)_: A unique identifier for the customer's address. Unique to the Address Book only.

Addresses can be created from within business manager, using the [AddressBook](https://salesforcecommercecloud.github.io/b2c-dev-doc/docs/current/scriptapi/html/index.html?target=class_dw_customer_AddressBook.html) class in B2C Commerce Script, or using the [Create Customer Address](../endpoints/customer/ShopperCustomers/create-customer-address.md) SCAPI endpoint.

Addresses can be retrieved using the [AddressBook](https://salesforcecommercecloud.github.io/b2c-dev-doc/docs/current/scriptapi/html/index.html?target=class_dw_customer_AddressBook.html) class in B2C Commerce Script or using the [Get Customer Address](../endpoints/customer/ShopperCustomers/get-customer-address.md) SCAPI endpoint.

## Customer Groups

Customer groups are used to dynamically or explicitly associate customers to a segment. These customer groups can be used for several purposes: dynamic content, recommendations, campaigns & promotions, as well as any use case that requires targeting users by segment specifically.

From within the customer section of business manager, customers can be manually assigned to customer groups. Additionally, dynamic customer groups that the customer is a part of will appear here.

## Active Data

Active data represents calculated insights from the platform based on their behavior on the site. These attributes can be used when creating dynamic customer groups, as well as used for dynamic product recommendations using Einstein.
