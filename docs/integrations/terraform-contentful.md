# Terraform for contentful

## Introduction

This Terraform implementation aims to streamline the setup process for our accelerator's integration with contentful. Traditionally, a script was responsible for creating necessary resources such as content-type, space, environment etc. before importing products. With Terraform, we can automate and manage these resource setups, making it easier to create and manage environments.

## Project Overview

The Terraform implementation covers the creation of the following resources:

**contentful**:
1. **Space**
2. **Environment**
3. **Contenttype**
4. **Asset**

## Benefits

- **Automation**: Automates the creation of resources, reducing manual setup and potential for errors.
- **Manageability**: Facilitates easy management and modification of resources.
- **Environment Replication**: Simplifies the process of spinning up new environments.

## Resources Documentation

Each resource has its own detailed documentation. Developers should refer to these links to understand the implementation specifics:

**contentful**
- [Space](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/labd/contentful/latest/docs/resources/space)
- [Environment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/labd/contentful/latest/docs/resources/environment)
- [Content-type](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/labd/contentful/latest/docs/resources/contenttype)
- [Asset](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/labd/contentful/latest/docs/resources/asset)

## Implementation Details

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the following tools are installed and configured:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [contentful Organization ID and CMA token](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Go to the terraform resources folder**:
    ```bash
    cd composable-pro/packages/terraform/contentful
    ```

2. **Configure Terraform**:
    - Update the `secret.auto.tfvars` file with your Contentful credentials. An example file `secret.auto.tfvars.example` is provided. Rename it to `secret.auto.tfvars` and fill in the following parameters:
    ```hcl
    #contentful
    cma_token         = "changeme"
    organization_id   = "changeme"
    ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4. **Plan the Infrastructure**:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

5. **Apply the Configuration**:
    ```bash
    terraform apply -parallelism=1
    ```

### Example Configuration

Below is an example of how to define a channel resource in `contentful.contenttype.tf`:

```hcl
resource "contentful_contenttype" "example_contenttype" {
  space_id = "space-id"
  name = "richText"
  display_field = "title"

  field {
    id = "title"
    name = "Title"
    type = "Symbol"
  }
}
```

Replicate similar configurations for the other resources as needed.

## Importance of Remote Backend for Terraform State

By default, Terraform stores state locally in a file named `terraform.tfstate`. When working with Terraform in a team, using a local file complicates Terraform usage because each user must ensure they always have the latest state data before running Terraform and must ensure that nobody else runs Terraform at the same time.

With remote state, Terraform writes the state data to a remote data store, which can then be shared among all members of a team. This approach has several benefits:

- **Collaboration**: Team members can collaborate more effectively as they all have access to the same state data.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that everyone is working with the most up-to-date state, preventing conflicts and potential state corruption.
- **Security**: Remote backends can offer additional security features, such as encryption and access control, to protect the state file.

Terraform supports storing state in various remote backends, including Terraform Cloud, HashiCorp Consul, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, etcd, and more. For more details on setting up a remote backend, refer to the Terraform documentation:

[Terraform Remote State Backend](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/FlexibleEngineCloud/flexibleengine/latest/docs/guides/remote-state-backend)

## Usage

Once the resources are created by Terraform, the existing script can focus solely on importing products without worrying about setting up the infrastructure. This decouples the installation process from the data import process, enhancing modularity and manageability.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Terraform for managing contentful resources, we achieve a more robust, scalable, and maintainable setup for our accelerator. This implementation not only simplifies the initial setup but also makes it easier to manage and replicate environments as needed.
